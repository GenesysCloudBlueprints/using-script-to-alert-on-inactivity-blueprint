  This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint explains how to set up Genesys Cloud and Microsoft 365 for agents to schedule a meeting with customers using Microsoft Teams. The agents can now directly schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting from Genesys Cloud. Genesys Cloud automatically sends an SMS message with the meeting URL to the customer and also opens the Microsoft Teams for the agent. The call can be either inbound or outbound as long it is in a queue.
